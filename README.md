# WHO Air Pollution – Executive Storytelling System

⭐ Featured 6-week Canva Data Visualization & AI Design Externship Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global air pollution data using the WHO dataset and transforms it into a structured executive storytelling system.

Workflow:
Excel → Flourish → Story Mode → Canva Template

The analysis moves from macro-level global exposure to city-level distribution and pollutant driver comparison.

---

## 🎯 Analytical Objective

Air pollution affects every region — but not equally.

This project explores:

- Global PM2.5 distribution
- Country-level exposure benchmarking
- City-level AQI category distribution
- Identification of dominant pollutant drivers
- Structured drill-down storytelling

---

## 🧮 Data & Statistical Approach

- Cleaned and standardized WHO dataset in Excel
- Calculated mean PM2.5 concentrations
- Calculated mean AQI values
- Aggregated data by global, country, and city levels
- Applied ranking and benchmarking logic
- Considered skew and limitations of mean values

---

## 🌍 Multi-Level Drill-Down Logic

1️⃣ Global projection map to identify regional clustering  
2️⃣ Country ranking to surface high exposure concentrations  
3️⃣ City-level AQI distribution to clarify hidden patterns  
4️⃣ Pollutant comparison to identify primary AQI driver  

Country-level alone was insufficient to fully explain patterns, so city-level segmentation provided deeper clarity.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Excel** (Cleaning & aggregation)
- **Flourish** (Interactive maps & charts)
- **Flourish Story Mode** (Narrative sequencing)
- **Canva** (Reusable executive template design)
- WHO Global Dataset

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- PM2.5 exposure is unevenly distributed globally
- A small set of countries show significantly elevated concentrations
- Most cities fall within moderate AQI ranges, but a minority face severe health risks
- PM2.5 is a major driver of overall AQI risk in the U.S.
